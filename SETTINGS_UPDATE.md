## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `components/SettingsModal.tsx` - Added language and currency selectors
- `hooks/useLocalization.ts` - Added persistence for user preferences

### How It Works:
1. On app start, the hook checks for saved preferences
2. If found, uses saved language/currency
3. If not found, uses device locale detection
4. When user changes settings, saves to storage
5. Settings persist across app restarts

### Storage Keys:
- `language` - Stores selected language code (e.g., 'en', 'es')
- `currency` - Stores selected currency code (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR')

## UI/UX Features

### Modal Design:
- Slides up from bottom
- Semi-transparent overlay
- Rounded corners
- Scrollable list for many options
- Search-friendly (easy to scan)

### Visual Feedback:
- Selected option highlighted with green background
- Green checkmark icon for selected item
- Bold text for selected option
- Smooth transitions

### Dark Mode Support:
- All modals support dark mode
- Proper contrast in both themes
- Consistent with app design
