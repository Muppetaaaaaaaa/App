# BetterU App - Progress Update
**Date:** October 6, 2025

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Navigation Bar Translation ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Tab labels were hardcoded in English
- **Fix:** Added `useLocalization` hook to `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- **Result:** All navigation tabs now translate instantly based on user preference
- **Files Modified:** `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`

### 2. Workout Weight Input Visibility ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** White text on white background in dark mode
- **Fix:** Added `weightInputDark` style with proper background color (#374151)
- **Result:** Weight input now visible in both light and dark modes
- **Files Modified:** `components/WorkoutCreator.tsx`

### 3. Barcode Scanner Serving Size Calculation ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Incorrect nutritional calculations - 9g showing 100g values
- **Root Cause:** OpenFoodFacts API returns values per 100g, but code was using `serving_quantity`
- **Fix:** Changed calculation to always use 100g as base for grams mode
  - Grams mode: `multiplier = amount / 100`
  - Portions mode: `multiplier = amount * (serving_size / 100)`
- **Result:** Accurate nutritional calculations for any gram amount
- **Files Modified:** `components/BarcodeScanner.tsx`
